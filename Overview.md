Introduction
============


Objectives:
-----------


### Github
* github setup
* friending me
* choosing gravatar
* culture

### Getting Setup with Eclipse
* (I have a screencast on my Youtube Channel if you want to set it up at home, handing out business cards with url, or can email you the value)
* you would do this, _fast-forward_.
* This is eclipse, it's what the pros use, not app inventor.
* for now choose one of these icons, you'll improve it later.
* being able to create user interface with Eclipse's Pro Dev Environment
  * rapidly building the stuff on the gui-viewer, then adding fine-tuning in the code side (buttons are uneven and I'm OCD)
* learning how to tie the clicks to actions using Java, and lot's of copypasta (results first (i.e. gc) + familiarity)
* now and then, you'll need to ask permission from your device to do the fun stuff
  * use the internet
  * send a text message
  * .. but it's really easy, all you have to do is "bam" copypasta -- right here, right below this line...
* ready to publish
* publishing a monetized app to the app store

I'll buy everyone's app today.

* Tell your parents and relatives and friends to support your studies by purchasing this cool app.

* things your app can do:
  * make a phone call
  * send a text message
  * open a webpage
  * turn on the flashlight
  * give you your gps coordinate


* **hackety-hack**
* profit
* plus looks good on one's college-application regardless of which field (everyone wants an app)


## Level 2: Taking Input and Using it

Leveling up your app: 

Hard-coded values in previous app: send a text to _______ button

Now we'll go over how to add input:

Gui Viewer -> Edit Text drag and drop

publish level 2 (increase the price):

## Level 3: Free app monetization

So far we've been buying these apps, but to reach more people, you should have a free version with really annoying ad placement (they can love your app, but hate them adds).

You can add adds to your app, so you can get money without even selling your app.

Also boosts your creds

## Level 4:
