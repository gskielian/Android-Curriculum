Introduction
============


Objectives:
-----------

* being able to create user interface with Eclipse's Pro Dev Environment
  * rapidly building the stuff on the gui-viewer, then adding fine-tuning in the code side (buttons are uneven and I'm OCD)
* learning how to tie the clicks to actions using Java, and lot's of copypasta (results first (i.e. gc) + familiarity)
* now and then, you'll need to ask permission from your device to do stuff
  * use the internet
  * send a text message
  * .. but it's really easy, all you have to do is "bam" copypasta -- right here, right below this line...
* publishing a monetized app to the app store
* hackety-hack
* profit
* plus looks good on one's college-application
