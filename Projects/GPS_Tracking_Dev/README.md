One of the key features of the android phone is GPS Tracking.

A basic and fun and practical project here is to create an app which turns on the GPS, and then 

This can be then used for:

* High Altitude Weather Balloons -- like we had ours last summer (but cheaper and lighter)

## GPS for great good!

* get the permission (+ gps abilities to your app)
  * android manifest
* writing the java code to get the gps data

* Give something pretty for your user to look at while it logs their data
  * how to add images
  * how to add text 

* writing the java code to do something with it
  * Options
    * text the data to a cell phone (must add texting permissions)
    * email the data to an email account (must add email permissions)
    * push the data to Firebase (must add internet permissions)
